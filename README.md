# Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains my solutions for the [2020 edition of the Advent of Code programming puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2020). The code and the input files for each day are in the corresponding directories. This year i program in java. Each solution is a single file java program which you can try with `java A.java < Ainput.txt` (requires java 11 or later).
